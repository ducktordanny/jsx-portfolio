# JSX-Portfolio

> A porfolio what describes you as JSX.

## Features

There are more types of components what let's you make a JSX styled description and also interact with it. Currently available three of them: ParentComponent, SelfClosingComponent, LinkComponent. (./components/code.tsx)

I think the first two might be kind of onbious if you have ever worked with React. However, the third one is a special one, because it can be clicked and also you can navigate with it since it uses next/link under the hood, but only if you add the navigation prop otherwise it's gonna work as a simple "a" tag.

The goal is that I want to be able to make some JSON files with the data what should be displayed on the site.

## Made with

Made with the fantastic Next.js and also used TypeScript, tailwindcss and gsap.
